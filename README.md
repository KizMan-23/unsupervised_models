Unsupervised_Models is a repository for models trained using unsupervised techniques.

unsupervised model is a machine learning technique in which the data are not pre-labelled but the algorithm identifies patterns, 
relationships underlining the data and they are grouped according to those similarities

[Clusters]() is a project that showcases the underlining algorithm of different cluster techniques such as KMeans Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, Hierrachical Clustering
